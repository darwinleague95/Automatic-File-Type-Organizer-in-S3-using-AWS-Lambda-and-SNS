üìÇ Project Overview
This project automatically organizes files uploaded to an S3 bucket into folders based on their file types (like images, documents, videos, etc.) using AWS Lambda. When a file is uploaded to the S3 bucket, a Lambda function is triggered to sort and move the file to the appropriate folder.

üöÄ Features
Automatically organizes files by type (e.g., .jpg, .pdf, .mp4).

Uses AWS Lambda for serverless execution.

Triggered by S3 ObjectCreated events.

Supports custom file type mappings.

Logs execution details to CloudWatch.

‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
AWS Account

IAM Role with:

AmazonS3FullAccess

AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole

S3 Bucket

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
1. Create an S3 Bucket
Go to AWS S3 ‚Üí Create a new bucket.

2. Create a Lambda Function
Go to AWS Lambda ‚Üí Create function.

Runtime: Python 3.x

Assign an IAM role with S3 Full Access and CloudWatch Logs permissions.

3. Add S3 Trigger to Lambda
Configure the Lambda trigger for the ObjectCreated (All) event on your S3 bucket.

4. Deploy the Code
Upload your lambda_function.py to AWS Lambda.

5. Test the Setup
Upload files of different types to your S3 bucket.

Check if the files are moved to their respective folders.

üìÇ File Type Mapping Example
python
Copy code
file_type_mapping = {
    'images': ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif'],
    'documents': ['.pdf', '.docx', '.txt'],
    'videos': ['.mp4', '.mov', '.avi'],
    # Add more types if needed
}
üìà Monitoring
Go to CloudWatch > Log Groups > /aws/lambda/{Your Lambda Function Name}

Check logs for:

Trigger events

Success and error messages

File movements

üõ°Ô∏è IAM Policy Example
Make sure your Lambda role has the following permissions:

json
Copy code
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:PutObject",
    "s3:DeleteObject"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
}
